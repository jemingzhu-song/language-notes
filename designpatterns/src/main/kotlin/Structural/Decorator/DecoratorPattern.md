The Decorator Pattern allows you to dynamically add fields and/or methods to classes without having to extend/inherit
that class. This gives flexibility when you want to add extra functionality to objects instead of entire classes.

Kotlin "solves" the Decorator Pattern as it offers the "Object Expressions" feature. However, other languages do not
offer such features, and this is where the Decorator Pattern steps in.
