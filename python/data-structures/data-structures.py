# ---------- Data Structures ---------- #
# A data structure is the means by which a program stores pieces of information (i.e. data) in a 
# systematic way (i.e. structured) so that it can be handled and processed during the program's execution. 
# We have already seen some basic (low-level) data structures with the basic data types (e.g. ints, floats, 
# booleans, strings, etc) - these are structured representations of small pieces of information. 
# As programmers, however, we typically consider data structures at a conceptually higher level: using the 
# basic data types as the fundamental units of data and considering structures built up from these - for example 
# sequences of ints.

# This week's content introduces you to some of the most useful built-in data structures provided 
# by Python: lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries. As programming languages have developed, agglomeration 
# structures such as these have proven to be the cornerstone to working with data, and Python has some of the 
# most powerful techniques for manipulating these data structures among modern programming languages.
