# language-notes

A collection of notes and resources that I wrote and compiled when learning various programming languages!

Notes about a specific language are saved in that language's file format, with the actual "Notes" written as comments, and actual "Code" written as code

Happy Learning! 🎓 💻 👩🏻‍💻 🧑🏻‍💻
