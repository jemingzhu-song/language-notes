    Notes: https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/collection-interface
    1.  The "collection" interface is the root interface of the Java collections framework.
        There is no direct implementation of this interface, it is implemented through its
        subinterfaces like "List", "Set", and "Queue". (e.g. the ArrayList class implements the
        List interface, which is a subinterface of the Collection interface)
    2.  The subinterfaces of "collection" interface:
            i) List Interface
            ii) Set Interface
            iii) Queue Interface
    3.  The "collection" interface consists of variable methods that can be used to perform different
        operations on objects. They are avaialble in all of its subinterfaces:
            1)  add() - inserts the specified element to the collection
            2)  size() - returns the size of the collection
            3)  remove() - removes the specified element from the collection
            4)  iterator() - returns an iterator to access elements of the collection
            5)  addAll() - adds all the elements of a specified collection to the collection
            6)  removeAll() - removes all the elements of the specified collection from the collection
            7)  clear() - removes all the elements of the collection
