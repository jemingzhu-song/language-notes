    Notes:
    1. An object is any entity that has a state and behaviour. e.g. a Bicycle is an object, it has:
        i) States: idle, first gear, second gear, etc.
        ii) Behaviours: braking, accelerating, etc.
    2. A class is a blueprint for the object. Before we create an object, we need to define a class.
       We can create many objects from the same class.
